# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this process is to summarize the students and schools within the district. There was academic dishonesty within the district, however, so the students in question were removed from the data. 

## Results

* The district summary was affected by the removal of the students. The percentages of the students passing math and reading decreased by about 1%. 

* Thomas High School's data was affected within the school summary, yet only slightly. All of the percentages decreased by less than a percent.

* The change for Thomas High School after removing the 9th graders kept them in second when compared to the rest of the district. 

* Removing the ninth graders does the following decreased all of Thomas High School's information by just under 1%, which does not change much of the data. 


### Student Analysis Summary 


The data was changed by removing the Thomas High School 9th graders in the following ways:

* Firstly, 461 students were removed from the high schools graders. This affects the percentage of:
    * students passing math
    * students passing reading   
    * overall students passing
* This also affects the total 9th results for those categories.
* Initialy, the percentages were much lower when compared to the original amount of students, so the total students who were graded needed to be changed. Once the total number of students without na was found, the percentages aligned properly. 
* Something surprising was that Thomas High School stayed number two in performance. With the 9th graders having academic dishonesty, it would make sense if the percentages were inflated. This was not the case.
